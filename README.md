# Easy Challenge 

FizzBuzzNormal is the first console application which prints a standard implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem to the console.

FizzBuzzTwist is another console application which prints the values specified in the Easy Challenge instructions. 

CustomInput is a third console application which fully utilizes all methods defined in the TwistedFizzBuzz class library and allows full user input to make selections for each option. 

Tests folder contains a set of tests that check to make sure all methods function properly. 

TwistedFizzBuzz_Library is the class library I created to support the  console applications as requested in the challenge instructions
